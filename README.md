# <Prework Study Guide Website>

## Description

I wanted to build a study guide webpage that would give display in the console a list of subjects to study and random topic as a study recommendation. This is a helpful learning tool for studing coding concepts. I built this project to help bootcamp students study. It solves the problem of not having a study guide accessable on a webpage. I learned how to build a webpage with basic functionality using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
